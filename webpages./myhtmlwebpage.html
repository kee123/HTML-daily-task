    <h2>Tamil Nadu government moves Supreme Court, says NEET violates basic structure, equality and federalism</h2>
    <img src="https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/mrzf81/article66526715.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/IMG_SUPREME_COURT_MCD_EL_2_1_VPARHLTK.jpg">
    <p style="font-size: medium">
        The Tamil Nadu government on Saturday moved an original suit in the Supreme Court for a declaration that the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) as the sole gateway for entry into medical courses is a violation of the Basic Structure of the Constitution, violation of the fundamental right to equality and an anathema to the principles of federalism.
        
        The suit, filed through advocate Sabarish Subramanian, under Article 131 of the Constitution has arraigned the Union of India as a defendant. It said that the court should declare “the marks obtained in the NEET will be the criterion for admission to medical and allied courses as ultra vires the provisions of the Constitution of India, violative of the basic structure of the Constitution, and are manifestly arbitrary as being violative of Article 14 of the Constitution.”
        
        It said Tamil Nadu was constrained to approach the top court as the “introduction and continuance of the NEET exam has adversely affected the students in the State of Tamil Nadu, in particular students from rural areas and students from Tamil Nadu State Board of Education affiliated schools.”</p><a href="https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/mrzf81/article66526715.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/IMG_SUPREME_COURT_MCD_EL_2_1_VPARHLTK.jpg">Click here to know more</a>
